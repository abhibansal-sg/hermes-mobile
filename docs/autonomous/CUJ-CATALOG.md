# Critical User Journeys (CUJ) — the app's "must always work" catalog

**This file is the contract for staging smoke coverage.** Layer 3 of the test
pyramid: unit tests catch logic (layer 1), per-fix regression tests catch
recurrence (layer 2), THIS catalog catches "a user can no longer do a core
thing" (layer 3), the soak catches systemic decay under abuse (layer 4),
TestFlight + Abhi catch taste (layer 5).

## Rules (build practice, locked 2026-07-03)

1. **Every shipped feature that adds a user-facing capability MUST add or amend
   a CUJ entry in the same PR.** The reviewer's craft checklist includes this.
   No entry → the feature is invisible to the smoke gate → review FAIL.
2. Each CUJ has a **machine-checkable smoke** (REST/WS against the staging
   gateway) — cheap (<30s each), deterministic, evidence-producing. UI-only
   journeys (pure SwiftUI behavior) are marked `smoke: ios-sim` and covered by
   the iOS test suite instead — the smoke runner skips them but counts them.
3. The soak beat runs the FULL catalog first (breadth), THEN its abuse suites
   (depth). A CUJ failure = DO-NOT-SHIP, same as an abuse failure.
4. Keep it honest-sized: a CUJ is a JOURNEY (user intent), not an endpoint.
   Target ≤20 entries; consolidate rather than sprawl.

## Catalog (v1 — derived from shipped surface as of build 58)

| id | journey | smoke | added by |
|----|---------|-------|----------|
| CUJ-01 | Pair a device and get an authed session | `POST /api/devices/issue` + authed `/api/status` | core |
| CUJ-02 | Send a prompt, receive a completed reply | REST session create → prompt → completion | core |
| CUJ-03 | Gateway dies mid-turn → iOS survives, shows reconnecting, auto-recovers, re-attaches to the open session, and refreshes the transcript | WS flap + reconcile; `smoke: ios-sim` ConnectionStoreReconnectTests mid-turn drop path (ABH-276/278/288/289/355) | Malacca/ABH-355 |
| CUJ-04 | Approve/deny a pending approval from the phone; reply to a clarification from lock screen | `/api/approvals/respond` contract (ABH-258 ownership) + `/api/approvals/reply` clarify-only contract (ABH-296) | core |
| CUJ-05 | Sessions list, source-grouped drawer, search, resume | Recents default excludes cron/subagent + empty sessions; `smoke: ios-sim` drawer opens with reachable Chats + Telegram source groups only, honest counts/empty/error states, and no cron/subagent drawer bucket; `/api/sessions/search` + resume + messages readback | core/ABH-345 |
| CUJ-06 | Enable relay push + pair + truthful test-push | `/relay/config` → `/relay/pair` → `/relay/test-push` → `/relay/status` truthfulness, including direct-APNs vs relay vs no-push-configured outcomes (ABH-282/283/284/285, ABH-213, ABH-314) | wave-68 |
| CUJ-07 | Device tokens: pair → APNs token registers, honest Settings state, list, revoke (scope-gated) | iOS pair/foreground registers `/push/register`; with relay configured, POST `/push/register` exercises relay `register_device` enrollment without delaying the REST 200; Settings shows not-authorized / not-registered / registered truthfully; `/api/devices`, DELETE + approve-scope 403 (ABH-329, ABH-315, ABH-275, ABH-270) | push lineage |
| CUJ-08 | Provider list + key entry (no key leak in response) | `/api/providers` + `/providers/{slug}/key` write→readback redacted | provider mgmt |
| CUJ-09 | Cron jobs: list, delivery-failure surfaced, and live "Deliver to" target selection | `/api/cron/jobs` + `/api/cron/delivery-targets`; `smoke: ios-sim` opens cron editor, sees only connected targets, shows the home-channel hint for unconfigured-home targets, saves the chosen `deliver`, and keeps a CLI-created exotic `deliver` value selected instead of blank | cron/ABH-265 |
| CUJ-10 | File attach/upload → agent sees it | `/api/upload` + fs/read contract | share/capture |
| CUJ-11 | Kanban/agents visibility (active agents view) | `/api/agents` shape sanity | ops surface |
| CUJ-12 | Slash-command launcher lists real commands | slash-commands route (#104, ABH-228) | build 58 |
| CUJ-13 | Learning Journey read surface loads | learning.frames/detail (ABH-246) | build 56 |
| CUJ-14 | Credits/billing view loads (view-only) | credits surface (ABH-237) | build 56 |
| CUJ-15 | Manual context compress action | compress route (ABH-222) | build 55 |
| CUJ-16 | YOLO/flow-state approval-bypass toggle honored | toggle write + approval behavior contract (ABH-227) | build 55 |
| CUJ-17 | Device-limit 409 surfaced without composer lock | `/api/devices/issue` at limit → 409 contract (ABH-254) | fix lineage |
| CUJ-18 | Debug share bundle from settings | `/api/debug-share` produces a bundle (#90) | support |
| CUJ-19 | Recover the gateway from the phone (restart + update) with honest reconnecting state | POST /api/gateway/restart → poll /api/actions/gateway-restart/status until running:false; badge reads reconnecting while in-flight | Malacca |
| CUJ-20 | iPad keyboard user sends a message and navigates with Cmd shortcuts | `smoke: ios-sim` RootKeyboardShortcutActionsTests verifies shortcut action symbols fire / are wired | ABH-308 |
| CUJ-21 | iOS artifact-gallery image opens full-screen, zooms, and closes | `smoke: ios-sim` ZoomableImageViewTests verifies fit math, zoom/pan clamp invariants, double-tap min→zoom/reset toggle, and swipe-down dismiss gate; UI smoke must open an image artifact into `artifactZoomableImageViewer`, exercise pinch/double-tap zoom behavior, then close via `zoomableImageCloseButton`/swipe dismiss | ABH-242 |
| CUJ-22 | Projects tab loads real projects with session counts | `GET /api/plugins/hermes-mobile/projects` returns a JSON array of `{id,label,root,session_count}`; 401 without token; junk-filtered (no ~/.hermes, no bare home); empty → `[]` | ABH-350 |
| CUJ-23 | Turn ends by any path → Live Activity shows ended, never a zombie timer | `smoke: ios-sim` verifies staleDate expiry is visual END; plugin pytest proves non-happy teardown/startup sweep emit ActivityKit end frames | ABH-361 |

`smoke: ios-sim` (covered by iOS test suite, skipped by gateway smoke): stale
'Connection lost' warning clears on clean resume (ABH-289 tests), per-event
push toggles gate local notifications (ABH-269), share-extension inbox drain
toast (ABH-277), cron delivery target picker truthfulness/legacy-selection
(ABH-265).

## Maintenance

- Refiner: when promoting a feature, note which CUJ it lands in (or that it
  adds one). Orchestrator: the engineer card for a user-facing feature includes
  "add/amend CUJ entry + smoke" in SCOPE.
- The soak beat reads this file every run; entries it cannot smoke (route gone,
  contract changed) are DO-NOT-SHIP evidence — the catalog IS the contract.
